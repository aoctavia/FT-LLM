## üìà Evaluation

### 1. Inference Testing

Sample prompts and generated responses:
```
Prompt: What is the photoelectric effect in medical imaging?
Response: The Photovoltaic Effect (photoelectron emission) describes how X-rays interact with matter, producing electromagnetic interactions through energy deposition and subsequent electron ejection from atoms or molecules of interest using high-energy radiation such as x-rays. This phenomenon forms the basis for many diagnostic procedures like radiography, fluoroscopy, and digital tomosynthesis.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prompt: Calculate the half-value layer for 100 keV X-rays in aluminum.
Response: The Half Value Layer (HVL) of any material refers to the thickness required so that radiation intensity reduces by one half compared with its original value. For X-rays specifically, their interaction involves electromagnetic interactions like scattering and absorption, which depend upon energy, frequency, and material composition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prompt: Explain the principles of IMRT planning.
Response: IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy) treatment plans are designed using sophisticated software and take into account patient anatomy, tumor characteristics, dose constraints for surrounding healthy tissues, and overall treatment goals. 
- **Patient Positioning:** Ensures accurate targeting with minimal divergence.  
- **Planning Target Definition:** Tumor regions are defined on CT/MRI scans by oncologists and physicists.  
- **Treatment Planning:** 3D models define precise dose delivery while minimizing risk to nearby organs at risk.  
The plan undergoes review and evaluation before clinical use.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prompt: What are the main components of a PET scanner?
Response: A PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scanner consists of three main components:  
1) A cyclotron to produce isotopes  
2) An injection system for radiopharmaceuticals  
3) A detector ring equipped with radiation detectors  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prompt: Describe radiation safety principles in nuclear medicine.
Response: Radiation Safety Principles (RSP) include minimizing patient dose through shielding, optimizing effective doses using low-dose protocols, ensuring safe storage/transport/disposal of radioactive materials, and training healthcare professionals on biological effects of radiation to enable informed clinical decisions.
```

### 2. Domain-Specific MCQ Test

* **Q1. Absorbed dose unit?** ‚Üí Model answered Sv ‚ùå (Correct: Gy)
* **Q2. IMRT stands for?** ‚Üí Model answered correctly ‚úÖ
* **Q3. Half-life of I-131?** ‚Üí Model answered correctly ‚úÖ

**Domain accuracy**: `66.7% (2/3)`

## üöÄ Deployment

* ‚úÖ Model exported (`final_model/`) with `model_info.json`
* ‚úÖ Can be pushed to **HuggingFace Hub** for public/research use

Usage example:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("your-hf-username/medical-physics-llm")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("your-hf-username/medical-physics-llm")

prompt = "What is the photoelectric effect in medical imaging?"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=200)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
